# 🖥️ GitHub on the Command Line: Version Control for Genomics

On the **Innovator HPC**, we use the `git` command-line tool to track our "intellectual trail." This ensures that if we change a parameter in our assembly script and everything breaks, we can **deductively backtrack** to the last working version.

---

## 1. Initial Identity Configuration
Before running any commands, you must tell the HPC who you are. This metadata is attached to every "commit" (save point) you create.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"

```

---

## 2. The Git Workflow (The "Loop of Logic")

Git follows a specific sequence of actions to move code from your local HPC directory to the GitHub server.

### Step A: Initialize and Connect

If you haven't already cloned the repo, initialize your current folder:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd ~/genome_project

# Initialize the hidden .git directory
git init

# Connect your HPC folder to the GitHub website
git remote add origin [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)

```

### Step B: The "Staging" Area

Think of the staging area as a "pre-flight check." You select which files are ready to be saved.

```bash
# Add your assembly script
git add scripts/run_flye.slurm

# Add your evaluation logic
git add tutorials/Evaluation-Logic.md

```

### Step C: The "Commit" (The Permanent Record)

A commit is a snapshot of your project. Every commit requires a message describing **why** a change was made.

```bash
git commit -m "Add circularity check logic to Python evaluation script"

```

### Step D: The "Push" (Uploading to GitHub)

This sends your local snapshots to the cloud so your mentor can review them.

```bash
git push origin main

```

## 🛡️ Security: The `.gitignore` File

**CRITICAL:** Genomic data is massive. We never, ever upload raw `.fastq` or `.fasta` files to GitHub. GitHub is for **code**, not **data**.

Create a file named `.gitignore` in your project root:

```bash
nano .gitignore

```

**Paste these rules into the file:**

```text
# Ignore raw data
data/*.fastq.gz
data/*.fastq

# Ignore large assembly outputs
output/
logs/*.log

# Ignore Conda environments
envs/

```

## 🔬 Mentee Challenge: The "Diff" Logic

If you change a line in your `assembly_eval.py` script, run this command before you commit:

```bash
git diff scripts/assembly_eval.py

```

* **Question:** How does `git` "know" exactly which characters changed?
* **The Logic:** Git uses a **hashing algorithm (SHA-1)** to compare the state of your files. If even one space is added, the "hash" changes, signaling a modification.

---

## 🚀 Summary Checklist

1. **`git status`**: Check what has changed.
2. **`git add`**: Prepare changes for saving.
3. **`git commit`**: Save the snapshot with a logical note.
4. **`git push`**: Sync with the cloud.

```

### Next Step for the Mentee
Would you like me to show you how to generate a **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**? Since 2021, GitHub requires a token instead of a password for command-line access, which is often the first "stumbling block" for students on an HPC.
